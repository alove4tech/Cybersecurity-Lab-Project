# Lab Overview

This repository documents my cybersecurity homelab designed to practice:
- Defensive monitoring (SIEM)
- Detection engineering
- Incident response workflows
- Adversary emulation in a controlled environment

## Scope & Safety
- Targets are intentionally vulnerable lab VMs.
- The environment is isolated and used for learning/testing only.
- No testing is performed against systems I do not own or have explicit permission to test.
